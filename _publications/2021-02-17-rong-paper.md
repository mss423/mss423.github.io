Studies of attention emphasize cortical circuits for salience monitoring and top-down control. However, subcortical arousal systems have a major influence on dynamic cortical state. We hypothesize that task-related increases in attention begin with a “pulse” in subcortical arousal and cortical attention networks, which may be reflected indirectly through transient fMRI signals...
