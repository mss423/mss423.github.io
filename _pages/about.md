I am currently a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics advised by [Professor MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/) at the University of Maryland. I studied mathematics and biology at Cornell University from 2015 to 2019 and began my PhD in August 2020 after working for a year as a research associate at the Yale School of Medicine under [Dr. Hal Blumenfeld](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/hal_blumenfeld/).

Broadly, I am interested in approximation algorithms, auction / mechanism design, and game theoretic problems with work published at NeurIPS, AAAI, AAMAS, and ICML. A fundamental theme underlying my research is the application of different concepts of "fairness" to theoretical problems in algorithmic design.

***Latest Publication News:*** I will be at NeurIPS in December to present on our two recent works "An Improved Relaxation for Oracle-Efficient Adversarial Contextual Bandits" and "Fair Polylog Approximate Low-Cost Hierarchical Clustering" with my fantastic coauthors. Reach out if you want to meet up in New Orleans!

**April 4th, 2022:** I am incredibly excited to share that I was [awarded the National Science Foundation (NSF) graduate research fellowship](https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/4914)! I want to give a very warm shoutout to my mentors and peers from Cornell, Yale, the NIH, and UMD for all their help to get me to this stage of my career.
