I am currently a *PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Maryland*, working with [Professor MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/). I am mainly interested in approximate algorithms, auction / mechanism design, and game theoretic problems.

I did my *undergraduate studies in Mathematics with a minor in Cognitive Sciences at Cornell University* and between my undergraduate and graduate schooling, I worked as a post-graduate *research associate at Yale University's School of Medicine* in the field of 
computational neuroscience with [Dr. Hal Blumenfeld](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/hal_blumenfeld/). My research focused on the applications of machine learning and data science approaches to EEG and fMRI in an effort to better understand and treat absence epilepsy.
