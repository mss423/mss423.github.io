**Personal News (April 4th, 2022):** I am incredibly excited to share that I was [awarded the National Science Foundation (NSF) graduate research fellowship](https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/4914)! I want to give a very warm shoutout to my mentors and peers from Cornell, Yale, the NIH, and UMD for all their help to get me to this stage of my career.

I am currently a *PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Maryland*, working with [Professor MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/). I am mainly interested in approximate algorithms, auction / mechanism design, and game theoretic problems.

I did my *undergraduate studies in Mathematics with minors in Biological and Cognitive Sciences at Cornell University*. Between my undergraduate and graduate schooling, I worked as a post-graduate *research associate at Yale University's School of Medicine* in the field of 
computational neuroscience with [Dr. Hal Blumenfeld](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/hal_blumenfeld/). My research focused on the applications of machine learning and data science approaches to EEG and fMRI in an effort to better understand and treat absence epilepsy.
